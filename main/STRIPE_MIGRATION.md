# Stripe Payment Integration Migration

## Overview

Successfully migrated from PayPal to Stripe payment system across the entire workspace.

## Files Updated

### 1. Payment Components

- **`/src/app/components/CartView.js`** - Completely rewritten to use Stripe Checkout
  - Removed all PayPal references and components
  - Added `handleStripeCheckout()` function
  - Clean, functional payment modal with Stripe integration

### 2. API Routes

- **`/src/app/api/stripe/checkout-session/route.js`** - Creates Stripe Checkout sessions
- **`/src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.js`** - Handles Stripe webhooks for post-payment processing
- **`/src/app/api/stripe/verify-session/route.js`** - Verifies Stripe payment sessions
- **`/src/app/api/download-pdf/route.js`** - Updated to support both Stripe and legacy PayPal

### 3. Success Page

- **`/src/app/success/SuccessContent.js`** - Updated to handle Stripe session verification

### 4. Layout & Dependencies

- **`/src/app/layout.js`** - Removed PayPal script provider
- **`package.json`** - Removed `@paypal/paypal-js`, added `stripe` package

### 5. Environment Configuration

- **`.env.example`** - Updated with Stripe keys and removed PayPal references

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Stripe Configuration (Get from https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Site Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## How It Works

### 1. Payment Flow

1. User clicks "Pay with Card (Stripe)" in CartView
2. `handleStripeCheckout()` creates a Stripe Checkout session
3. User is redirected to Stripe's hosted checkout page
4. After payment, user returns to `/success?session_id=xxx`
5. Success page verifies the session and processes accordingly

### 2. Booking Flow (Coaching Products)

1. User selects time slot on calendar
2. Proceeds to payment with time slot data
3. Stripe session includes `selectedTimeSlot` in metadata
4. Webhook creates booking automatically after successful payment
5. Confirmation email sent with booking details

### 3. PDF Downloads (Book Products)

1. User purchases book product
2. Payment success triggers PDF download
3. Transaction recorded in Firebase for download verification

## Key Features

✅ **Complete PayPal Removal** - No traces of PayPal code remaining
✅ **Stripe Checkout** - Professional, hosted payment pages
✅ **Webhook Integration** - Automatic post-payment processing
✅ **Time Slot Booking** - Coaching sessions automatically booked
✅ **Email Automation** - Confirmation emails for all purchases
✅ **PDF Downloads** - Secure download verification
✅ **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Testing

### Test Cards (Use in Stripe test mode)

- **Success**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Declined**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- **3D Secure**: `4000 0000 0000 3220`

Use any future expiration date, any 3-digit CVC, and any ZIP code.

## Next Steps

1. **Set up actual Stripe account** at https://dashboard.stripe.com
2. **Replace test keys** with live keys in production
3. **Configure webhooks** in Stripe dashboard pointing to `/api/stripe/webhook`
4. **Test the complete flow** with test cards
5. **Remove PayPal context files** if no longer needed

## Stripe Dashboard Setup

1. Create account at https://dashboard.stripe.com
2. Get API keys from "Developers > API keys"
3. Set up webhook endpoint: `your-domain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
4. Select events: `checkout.session.completed`
5. Copy webhook signing secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
