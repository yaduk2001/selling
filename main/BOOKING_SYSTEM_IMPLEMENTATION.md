# Client-Side Pre-Payment Booking Flow Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides a complete booking system where customers can select specific time slots for coaching sessions before completing payment, with a temporary reservation system to prevent conflicts. **Now supports flexible booking durations** including 30-minute, 60-minute, and custom duration sessions.

## System Components

### 1. Frontend Components

#### BookingModal (`/src/app/components/BookingModal.js`)
- Interactive calendar for date/time selection with **duration-aware slot generation**
- Real-time availability checking considering **booking duration overlaps**
- 15-minute slot reservation with countdown timer
- **Dynamic slot display** showing start and end times
- Seamless transition to Stripe checkout

#### Updated Pricing Component (`/src/app/components/home/Pricing.js`)
- Differentiates between PDF and coaching products
- Opens booking modal for coaching sessions
- **Shows product duration in booking interface**
- Regular purchase flow for PDF products

### 2. Backend API Routes

#### Availability API (`/api/booking/availability`)
- `GET /api/booking/availability?date=YYYY-MM-DD&productId=123&duration=60`
- Returns available time slots for a specific date **considering booking duration**
- **Intelligent conflict detection** - prevents overlapping bookings of different durations
- **Dynamic slot generation** based on session length

#### Reservation API (`/api/booking/reserve-slot`)
- `POST /api/booking/reserve-slot`
- Creates 15-minute temporary reservations **with duration tracking**
- **Advanced conflict prevention** for overlapping time periods
- Supports any booking duration (30, 60, 90, 120 minutes, etc.)

#### Updated Stripe Integration
- Enhanced checkout session creation with booking metadata
- Webhook handling for booking confirmation
- Automatic account creation post-payment

### 3. Database Schema

#### Tables Created:
1. **`booking_reservations`** - Temporary 15-minute holds **with duration tracking**
2. **`bookings`** - Confirmed bookings after payment **with session duration**
3. **`calendar_events`** - Optional admin calendar view
4. **`products`** - Enhanced with `duration_minutes` field for flexible session lengths

## New Duration Features

UPDATE products SET duration_minutes = 30 WHERE name LIKE '%Quick%';
UPDATE products SET duration_minutes = 60 WHERE name LIKE '%Standard%'; -- Default
UPDATE products SET duration_minutes = 90 WHERE name LIKE '%Extended%';
UPDATE products SET duration_minutes = 120 WHERE name LIKE '%Deep%';
```
